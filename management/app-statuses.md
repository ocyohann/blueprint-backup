# App Statuses

_Read first:_ [_Ratings and Reviews_](https://blueprint.openchannel.io/marketplace/ratings-reviews/) _| Read next:_ [_Submission_](http://blueprint.openchannel.io/management/submission/)__

Depending on where it is in the app lifecycle, every app will have one of six statuses:

* Draft
* Pending Review
* In Review
* Approved
* Rejected
* Suspended

## Draft

Usually, developers will create and refine app submissions over the course of several days, weeks, or months before they submit them for review. As a result, developers should be able to save an unfinished app, automatically marking it as a _Draft_.

## Pending Review

Once an app is first [submitted](http://blueprint.openchannel.io/management/submission/), it enters the _Pending Review_ status. This means the app is now awaiting review, but changes can still be made by the developer.

## In Review

As soon as the app review teams begin reviewing an app, it enters the _In Review_ status. At this stage, the app is locked for further changes until the [review process](http://blueprint.openchannel.io/management/review/) is over.

## Approved

If an app meets all of the submission criteria, it will be [_Approved_](https://blueprint.openchannel.io/management/approval-rejection/). Following this, the app is automatically published to the marketplace and the developer is notified.

## Rejected

If an app does not meet the submission criteria, it will be [_Rejected_](https://blueprint.openchannel.io/management/approval-rejection/). In this case, the developer is notified and given the ability to resubmit their app after making the necessary changes.

## Suspended

An app that was previously approved can still be [_Suspended_](https://blueprint.openchannel.io/management/approval-rejection/) (i.e. removed) from an app marketplace. As in the case of a _Rejected_ app, the developer is notified and given the ability to resubmit their app after addressing the cause(s) for suspension.

## What's Next?

We've discussed the six major app statuses. On the next page — [Submission](http://blueprint.openchannel.io/management/submission/) — we'll take a closer look at handling app submissions and what they should include.
