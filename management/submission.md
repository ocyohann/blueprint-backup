# Submission

Most app marketplaces will need a process for collecting new app submissions. The most common way to take submissions is with a dedicated app submission form, which includes various items. On this page, we'll discuss:

* Taking Submissions
* Submission Items
* Save as Draft

## Taking Submissions

Depending on the platform and industry, many app marketplaces will allow developers to submit apps immediately after [registration](http://blueprint.openchannel.io/developer/onboarding/). This approach works best for open platforms where self-service is commonplace; however, it may increase the workload associated with reviewing app submissions.

Other app marketplaces will require developers to be manually approved before they can submit apps. This is often the preferred approach in enterprise environments (especially in heavily regulated industries) although it may deter some developers.

Regardless, app marketplaces almost always collect new app submissions through a dedicated submission flow. This can be a single form where the developer uploads app assets, or — for more complex apps — a multi-step wizard which divides the submission process into specific areas (e.g. assets, payments, security).

## Submission Items

Here are the most important items found in an app marketplace app submission form:

### The App Itself

For most app types, submissions should include the app itself:

* For web-based integrations, the developer can provide the URL at which the integration is hosted.
* For downloadable files, the developer can upload the file directly.
* For container-based apps, the developer can be given credentials for a repository to which they can push the app.

### App Assets

Submissions should include visual assets, like logos, screenshots, or videos, and textual assets (namely the app description):

### App Features

Similar to general app assets, submissions can also include screenshots, videos, and descriptions for individual app features.

### Other Metadata

Aside from the core app assets, submissions should also include any other app metadata, like the app name and category.

### Developer Information

Submissions should include the developer's details and assets, such as the name of the developer organization, its website, logo, and privacy policy.

### Support/Documentation Information

At the bare minimum, submissions should include a support contact. They may also include links to app documentation and other onboarding or support resources.

### Pricing Information

In the case of [paid apps](http://blueprint.openchannel.io/success/monetization/), submissions should include pricing information, such as the pricing model, the different pricing plans or tiers (if any), and what’s included in them.

### Internal Information

Where needed, platform owners can add additional items to submission forms for their own use. For example, submissions may require developers to describe how their app works (for testing reasons) or how they intend to provide support.

### Save as Draft

Developers will rarely complete their submission in one sitting. For this reason, platform owners should include the option to save a submission as a draft.

**Tip:** When deciding what items to include in a submission form, consider the end user's perspective — what questions will they ask before they make a decision?
