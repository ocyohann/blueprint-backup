# Approval and Rejection

_Read first:_ [_Review_](http://blueprint.openchannel.io/management/review/) _| Read next:_ [_Updates_](http://blueprint.openchannel.io/management/updates/)__

Following the [review process](http://blueprint.openchannel.io/management/review/), an app can either be approved or rejected. Together with suspension, these are the three most important actions administrators can take on an app:

* Approval
* Rejection
* Suspension

## Approval

An app should be approved if the review team determines that it meets all of the marketplace's submission and approval criteria. If there is more than one review team, the app should be individually approved by each team before it is considered fully approved. Following this, the app should be automatically added to the marketplace.

## Rejection

An app should be rejected if the review team determines that it fails to meet one or more of the marketplace's submission criteria. Following this, the developer should be [notified](https://blueprint.openchannel.io/developer/analytics-notifications/) about the rejection and given the chance to resubmit their app after making changes.

It's important the developer knows why their app was rejected. For this reason — and for internal reference — the review team will usually have to select a broad category for the rejection, such as “Vulnerabilities Found” or “Images Unacceptable”. In addition to this, the review team should provide a written explanation for the rejection.

In app marketplaces where the review process consists of multiple stages, an app that fails to meet the criteria for one stage may still be reviewed in subsequent stages. This way, the developer receives feedback for all aspects of the app, potentially reducing the number of times it needs to be resubmitted. For more best practices on rejecting apps, see [this blog post](https://openchannel.io/blog/rejecting-apps-app-marketplace/).

### Soft vs Hard Rejections

Apps that do not meet the marketplace's submission criteria are almost always subject to a soft rejection, which means that the developer can resubmit their app after making changes.

In rare cases, the review team may wish to issue a hard rejection, which means that the developer cannot or should not resubmit their app. This may be the case if the app's intended behavior does not align with the goals of the platform. With clear submission criteria, hard rejections are rarely necessary.

## Suspension

App marketplaces should give administrators the ability to suspend apps at any time. Suspensions are uncommon, but useful if apps stop working for a prolonged period of time or if customer support is unsatisfactory.
