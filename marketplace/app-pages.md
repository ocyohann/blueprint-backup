# App Pages

_Read first:_ [_Search and Categorization_](https://blueprint.openchannel.io/marketplace/search-categorization/) _| Read next:_ [_Ratings and Reviews_](https://blueprint.openchannel.io/marketplace/ratings-reviews/)__

When an app catches the user's interest, they'll want to know more about what it does and how they can install it. As a result, each app should have its own page or modal with more information. On this page, we'll discuss:

* Pages vs Modals
* What to Include

## Pages vs Modals

App details are usually displayed in one of two places: on a dedicated page or in a modal.

Most of the time, we suggest placing app details on a dedicated page. Although this requires users to sit through an extra page load, pages are much more flexible in terms of the number, size, and variety of page elements that can be included.

_SalesLoft Marketplace has dedicated pages for each app._

A modal is a separate dialog that opens when an app is clicked. Modals are a sleek and convenient way to show app details, but are limited to fewer page elements.

_Wix App Market uses modals to display app information._

They're best suited to displaying app details within a product, since they allow users to quickly read about the app without interrupting their workflow. To provide additional information, a "Learn More" (or equivalent) call to action can be particularly effective.

If you do opt to use modals, consider assigning them URLs to optimize for both sharing and search engine optimization.

## What to Include

In addition to the app's name, an app details page should include several items which tell (or show) the user about the app, who created it, and more.

### App Assets

Ideally, every app should have textual and visual assets. These are provided by the developer, and should be [reviewed](http://blueprint.openchannel.io/management/review/) against marketplace guidelines when the app is submitted.

The primary textual asset is an app description, which _describes_ what the app does. This provides essential information to users, who are trying to decide whether the app will be beneficial to them, and search engines, which will index the page based on textual content.

Visual assets, such as screenshots or videos, are used to _show_ what the app does. Not only do they make the app details page feel "fuller", but they can also increase engagement if users clearly see that the app offers valuable functionality.

_On the Shopify App Store, each app details page has a hero section, which includes a call to action, video, and overview of the app._

An app description should be a must for any app details page. While visual assets are also beneficial, you may choose to forego them if the nature of your marketplace's apps does not lend itself to being conveyed visually, though this is the exception.

### Call to Action

An app details page should also include some kind of call to action (CTA), which allows the user to move forward with activating the app.

The exact call to action used will depend on how app activation works on your marketplace.

If your marketplace supports one-click installation, where users can independently [activate](http://blueprint.openchannel.io/operations/oauth-activation/) apps with just one click, you might use a call to action like "Install", "Get", or "Activate".

However, if users need to contact you or the app developer before they can activate the app, a call to action like "Learn More", "Request a Demo", or "Contact" would be more suitable.

### Developer Information

Most app marketplaces feature apps built by external developers. If this is the case for your marketplace, be sure to include information about the developer on the app details page.

As a bare minimum, the app details page should have the name of the developer organization and a link to their website. It's also worth including the developer's logo, so as to establish trustworthiness.

Finally, when external developers are involved, the app details page should also provide a link to the developer's privacy policy.

### Pricing

In the case of [paid apps](http://blueprint.openchannel.io/success/monetization/), the app details page should include pricing information. Importantly, users should know whether they will be billed by your organization or the developer.

In either case, the app details page should describe the pricing model, the different pricing plans or tiers (if any), and what’s included in them. If payments are handled outside of the marketplace, there should be a link to detailed pricing terms elsewhere.

### Versioning

Some app marketplaces also choose to include versioning information on the app details page. This is particularly relevant if there are multiple concurrent versions of an app, each of which is compatible with a different version of the core product. (These issues mostly affect on-premises software.)

_The Atlassian Marketplace uses a dedicated tab to house versioning information._
