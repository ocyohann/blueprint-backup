## What Is Blueprint?

OpenChannel Blueprint is an open resource primarily designed for organizations that have launched or are considering launching an app marketplace and ecosystem. It's packed with best practices, tips, examples, and guidance to prevent setbacks and maximise results.

Blueprint is equally valuable for those who are discovering app marketplaces for the first time. The resource offers an in-depth look into the inner workings of app marketplaces enabling you to see exactly what is involved in building and maintaining one.

The resource is divided into six sections:

1. **Getting Started** – Key terms and concepts for app marketplaces and ecosystems
2. **The Marketplace** – Fundamental building blocks for a quality marketplace experience
3. **App Management** – The lifecycle of an app and associated workflows
4. **Developer Experience** – Best practices for onboarding and supporting developers
5. **Marketplace Success** – Ways to promote, monetize, and analyze app marketplaces
6. **Operations and Legal** – Supporting activities for security and compliance
