# Overview

There's a lot to think about when building an app marketplace, which may seem overwhelming. That's why we created this planning framework – to guide you through the most important considerations, questions, and steps, including:

* Common goals when building a marketplace
* Key roles in an app ecosystem
* Common use cases for apps
* How to begin moving forward

## 1. Common Goals

Companies can have a variety of goals when building a marketplace, like expanding product functionality, revenue generation, meeting industry expectations, and differentiation.

## 2. Ecosystem Roles

While ecosystems can vary, it’s important to think through the three key roles (marketplace owner, app developer, and end user) and what they will need to succeed.

## 3. Use Cases

As your ecosystem grows, you're likely to progress from one to many different use cases, including internal product features, web integrations, downloadable files, and lead generation, among others.
